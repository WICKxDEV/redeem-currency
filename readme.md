## Framework Adjustments
The script is designed for the es_extended framework. If you're using a different framework (e.g., QBCore, vRP), update the following lines in server.lua:

#### 3. Add the Script to Your Server
Open your server.cfg file.

Add the following line to start the script:
start redeem-currency

#### 4. Restart Your Server
Restart your FiveM server to load the script.

Enter the amount you want to redeem and confirm.

Check your Discord server for the transaction notification.

## Customization
Exchange Rate: To change the exchange rate, modify the exchangeRate variable in server.lua:
local exchangeRate = 100 -- $1 = 100 in-game coins
